# Conway's Game of Life LLM Benchmark

A benchmark for testing LLM spatial reasoning using Conway's Game of Life.

## What it does

Presents grid states as ASCII text and asks LLMs to compute the next generation. Tests pattern recognition, rule application, and spatial reasoning capabilities.

## Quick Example

**Input (given to LLM):**
```
.#.
